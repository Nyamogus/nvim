# My Neovim config based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)

[documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation)

If a key is the same on german and english keyboards, it'll not change, otherwise keybindings might differ and are subject to change
Installation works just like LazyVim

```
git clone https://github.com/Nyamogus/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```
